Scope
- This file will cover in-depth Payments guidance beyond Billing basics.

- This file is reviewed quarterly after each major release, current release is 2025-08-12

## IMPORTANT SCOPE LIMITATION

This file is incomplete.

Do NOT:
- Generate full payment orchestration flows
- Assume gateway configuration
- Implement retries beyond basic examples

For detailed Payments logic:
- Defer to OpenAPI and Payments FAQ
- Ask the user for clarification

Canonical sources (to be expanded)
- Payments FAQ: https://developer.zuora.com/docs/get-started/faq/zuora-payments/
- OpenAPI (Order-to-Cash): https://developer.zuora.com/yaml/zuora-openapi-for-otc.yaml

Key Concepts
- **Electronic Payment Collections**: Automating payment runs against invoices.
- **PCI-Compliant Storage**: Securely vaulting credit card and bank account data.
- **Hosted Payment Pages (HPP) and Payment Forms**: IFrame-based card capture to minimize PCI scope.
- **Payment Gateways**: Native integration with 50+ global gateways (Stripe, Adyen, Chase, etc.).
