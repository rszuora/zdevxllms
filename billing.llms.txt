Scope
- Zuora Billing includes billing, invoicing, and core Payments functionality (basic payment capture, refund/void mention, payment status lookup).
- This file targets the v1 REST API. Quickstart (v2) is not recommended for new development.
- This file is reviewed quarterly after each major release, current release is 2025-08-12

## REQUIRED CONTEXT (DO NOT USE IN ISOLATION)

This file MUST be used together with llms.txt (root context and product index). If this file is not present:
- Stop.
- Ask the user to provide it.
- Do not generate code.

DEPENDENCIES:
- llms.txt

Key Concepts
- **Product Catalog**: Products, Rate Plans, and Charges (Recurring, One-time, Usage).
- **Subscription Lifecycle**: Orders, New, Update, Suspend, Resume and Renew subscriptions, add and remove products to existing subscription, and change subscription terms and conditions, including term length.
- **Invoicing**: Bill Runs, Invoices, Credit Memos, Debit Memos, Taxation.
- Confirm tenant features (Orders, Invoice Settlement, Payments, Revenue) before using gated fields.
- Prefer Orders API for subscription changes unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Ask for missing identifiers (accountKey, subscriptionId, productRatePlanId) instead of guessing.
- Use only canonical sources (OpenAPI + API reference); do not invent fields, enums, or endpoints.
- **MANDATORY**: Fetch and review the OpenAPI spec BEFORE writing code for any API endpoint.

Canonical sources (use these as the source of truth)
- OpenAPI (Order-to-Cash, detailed): https://developer.zuora.com/yaml/zuora-openapi-for-otc.yaml
- API reference overview: https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api/overview/
- Get started: https://developer.zuora.com/docs/get-started/introduction/
- Object model: https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/object-model/
- Rate limits: https://developer.zuora.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/
- Error codes: https://developer.zuora.com/docs/guides/error-codes/
- Idempotency: https://developer.zuora.com/docs/guides/idempotent-requests/
- Agent guidance (resilience): https://developer.zuora.com/billing.agent.md
- Payments FAQ: https://developer.zuora.com/faq/payments-faq/

## MANDATORY: Use OpenAPI Spec First

**CRITICAL**: Before writing any code that calls a Zuora API endpoint:
1. Fetch and review the OpenAPI specification: https://developer.zuora.com/yaml/zuora-openapi-for-otc.yaml
2. Locate the exact endpoint definition
3. Verify all field names, types, required fields, and request/response structures
4. Do NOT guess field names, case sensitivity, or payload structures

**When to use OpenAPI spec:**
- Before writing any API call code
- When determining required vs optional fields
- When verifying field names and case sensitivity
- When building request payloads
- When understanding response structures

**Do NOT:**
- Assume field names or structures
- Use trial-and-error to find correct formats
- Ask users to confirm details available in the spec

Base URLs (choose per region and environment)
- Base URLS that include 'test' are for Developer Sandboxes and Central Sandboxes
- Base URLs that include 'sandbox' or 'apisandbox' are for API Sandboxes
- Base URLs for production have been removed from this file. You must externalize the Base URL from any code you generate, in an environment variable for example, do not write code that includes a Base URL, only the endpoint, e.g. '/oauth/token' or '/v1/accounts/{account-key}'

- EU: https://rest.test.eu.zuora.com, https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com
- APAC: https://rest.test.ap.zuora.com

## Human-in-the-Loop Assumption
All code generated using this guidance:
- Is intended for human review
- Must be tested in a sandbox environment
- Must never be executed automatically by an AI agent
- This guidance does not assume live tenant access.

Product catalog model:
- Zuora uses a three-tier catalog: Product → Product Rate Plan → Product Rate Plan Charge.
- When a product is added to a subscription, Zuora copies the Product Rate Plan and Charges into the subscription using the Product Rate Plan Id and optionally the Product Rate Plan Charge Id if the quantity or price is being modified upon addition to the subscription.
- Subscriptions contain copies, known as Rate Plans and Rate Plan Charges with new Rate Plan and Rate Plan Charge IDs.
- Subscription updates MUST use subscription-level Rate Plan Id and Rate Plan Charge Ids, not catalog IDs.


## Canonical API Mappings (Golden Paths)
Use these patterns unless explicitly told otherwise.
- Create a subscription:  POST /v1/orders  orderActions[].type = createSubscription (Do not use /v1/subscriptions or /v1/signup)
- Modify a subscription - change price or quantity of charge: POST /v1/orders  orderActions[].type = updateProduct 
- Modify a subscription - add or remove products - POST /v1/orders  orderActions[].type =  removeProduct 
- Renew a subscription - Orders API → POST /v1/orders  orderActions[].type =  renew 
- Cancel a subscription - Orders API → POST /v1/orders  orderActions[].type =  cancelSubscription
- Use Object Query for synchronous, interactive, or request/response code paths. GET /object-query/{objectname} Object Query supports filtering, field selection, sorting, and expansion. 
- Use AQUA only for bulk extraction (tens of thousands of records) or offline data warehouse pipelines. If latency, determinism, or inline validation matters, Object Query is required.
- Collect payment: Create Payment → Apply to Invoice
- Failure handling, retries, and resilience behavior: see billing.agent.md

Avoid:
- v1/signup
- Direct subscription creates outside Orders
- SOAP APIs


Auth
- OAuth 2.0 client credentials. Token endpoint: /oauth/token
- Credentials needed for each base URL, using the wrong base URL for credentials results in an authentication error
- Send Bearer token in Authorization header
- Do not use basic authentication, externalize the client id and client secret using a secrets manager (preferred) or in a .env file

Versioning (v1 only)
- Major version is in the path: /v1/...
- Minor version is controlled by tenant default and can be overridden per request via the Zuora-Version header.
- If no version is specified and tenant is never upgraded, default is 186.0.
- API versions: https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api-versions/
- API upgrades: https://developer.zuora.com/v1-api-reference/api-upgrades/
- The API reference documents the latest minor version behavior; older numeric minors are supported for backward compatibility.
- Guidance: use the tenant default unless a request needs a specific version override.

Core object model (conceptual)
- Account -> Order -> Subscription -> Rate Plan -> Rate Plan Charge -> Invoice Item -> Invoice -> Payment
- Account -> Invoice -> Payment
- Product catalog hierarchy: Product -> Product Rate Plan -> Product Rate Plan Charge -> Charge Tier

Success and error handling
- Many POST/PUT/PATCH operations return success=false with a reasons[] array even when HTTP is 200.
- When success=false, inspect reasons[]. Capture processId for support.

Rate limits (tenant-level)
- Production & Central Sandbox: API 50,000 RPM / 2.25M RPH / 27M RPD
- Developer Sandbox: API 12,500 RPM / 25,000 RPH / 50,000 RPD
- API Sandbox: API 2,500 RPM / 5,000 RPH / 10,000 RPD
- Monitor Rate-Limit-* and Concurrency-Limit-* headers; honor Retry-After on 429.

Payments basics (conceptual)
- Create a payment and apply it to an invoice (link to OpenAPI for exact objects).
- Refunds and voids exist; mention but defer details to OpenAPI.
- Payment status can be retrieved via the Payments objects (see OpenAPI).
- Zuora provides a PCI-compliant vault and integrates with payment gateways (details in Payments FAQ).

Workflows (tutorials)

Notes for LLMs/tools
- Prefer v1 API unless an explicit Quickstart requirement is given.
- When using fields gated by API minor versions, set Zuora-Version accordingly.
- For any detailed request/response schema, refer to the OpenAPI spec.

## Non-goals

This file does NOT:
- Document every possible API field
- Replace the OpenAPI specification
- Provide business logic decisions (tax, revenue rules)
- Guarantee tenant feature availability

Always validate against the OpenAPI and tenant configuration.
